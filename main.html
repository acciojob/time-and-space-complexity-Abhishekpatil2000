	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is amount of time required to execute the code,</p>
	<p>Space Complexity is the amount of memory an algorithm or data structure needs to solve a problem, based on the size of the input,In many cases, a function's <b>Space Complexity</b> is the same as its time complexity. For example, if a function takes O(n) time, it will also take O(n) space.</p>
